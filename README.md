## Project Overview

This project models a smart house system where energy sources (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines) produce energy, which is then stored in a central battery. Smart appliances consume the stored energy. The system:
- Handles concurrent operations for energy flow and logging.
- Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX.
- Tracks real-time energy trends and system usage.

## System Requirements

- **Java**: JDK 17 or later
- **JavaFX**: Configured in your development environment
- **Eclipse IDE**: Recommended for development
- **Git**: To clone the repository

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stevenson21/Group7-SmartHouse.git
   cd Group7-SmartHouse
2. Configure JavaFX in your development environment:

   - Download JavaFX SDK from [JavaFX Downloads](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
   - Add JavaFX libraries to your build path in your IDE.
   - Configure VM arguments in your IDE:
     ```bash
     --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
     ```

3. Open the project in your IDE and run the `SmartHouseUI` class.

## Features

### Smart Objects
- Manage appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators, and lighting systems.
- Toggle their state (ON/OFF), simulate faults, and repair them through an interactive UI.

### Energy Sources
- Add, remove, enable/disable, and repair energy sources dynamically.
- Simulate energy production in real-time and visualize trends using charts.

### Battery Management
- Monitor the charge/discharge status in real-time with a pie chart.
- Log charging and energy consumption activities to track system performance.

### Logging
- Comprehensive logging of all system activities, stored in text files.
- Search logs by date or equipment name using advanced filters.

---

## How It Works

### Smart Objects
- **States**: Objects can be toggled ON, OFF, or marked as FAULTY.
- **Energy Usage**: Each object consumes energy when turned ON.
- **Repairing Faults**: Faulty objects can be repaired via the management UI.

### Energy Sources
- **Production**: Each source simulates energy generation based on its production rate.
- **Faults**: Energy sources can develop faults and must be repaired to function again.

### Battery Management
- **Charging**: Energy generated by sources is stored in the battery until full.
- **Usage**: Appliances consume energy from the battery dynamically.
- **Visualization**: Real-time battery capacity is displayed using a pie chart.

---

## Concurrency

The Smart House Management System uses concurrency to optimize performance:

- **Log Searching**: Multi-threaded log searches for date and keyword filters.
- **Battery Operations**: Concurrent charging and usage simulation using separate threads.
- **Simulation Updates**: Real-time data visualization updates with concurrent tasks.

---

## Visualization

### Battery Status
- A pie chart shows the proportion of used and available energy.
- Updated dynamically during the simulation.

### Energy Trends
- Line charts display energy production and usage trends in real-time.
- Tooltips provide exact values and timestamps for data points.

### Fault and Repair Visualization
- Faulty devices are clearly marked in the UI.
- Real-time updates reflect repairs and enable/disable actions.

---

## Logging

### Activity Tracking
- All events (e.g., charging, usage, repairs) are logged in the `logs` directory.

### Search Functionality
- **By Date**: Filters logs by specific timestamps.
- **By Equipment Name**: Searches for logs related to specific sources or devices.

---

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Comprehensive JUnit tests cover:
  - Smart objects
  - Energy sources
  - Battery operations
  - Log search functionality

### Simulation Testing
- Stress-tested with concurrent energy production and consumption under high loads.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **IoT Integration**: Connect real sensors and appliances to gather live data for a more realistic simulation.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Use machine learning models to predict energy production and consumption trends.
- **Database Integration**: Store logs and system activity in a database for improved scalability and data analysis.
- **Mobile Application**: Build a mobile-friendly version for remote monitoring and control.
